    <p class="about-paragraph">Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or
        simply Santa,
        is a legendary character originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes
        of well-behaved children on the night of Christmas Eve (24 December)
        or during the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).
        The modern character of Santa Claus was based on traditions surrounding the historical
        Saint Nicholas (a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra), the British figure of
        Father Christmas, and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas).
        Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic deity Wodan, who was associated with the pagan
        midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky.
